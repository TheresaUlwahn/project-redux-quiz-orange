# Redux quiz project

https://mrsucodesproject14thequizgame.netlify.com/

A quiz game using Redux with multiple choice questions made in a team

## What I learned ðŸ§ 

* How to interact with the store using selectors or by dispatching actions
* Practice working in a development team

## Requirements ðŸ§ª

* Should have at least 5 questions.
* When the user selects an answer, it should show if they were correct or not.
* While going through the quiz, shows which question you're on, or how many left. 
* When the user has answered all the questions, they get to a summary screen which tells them how many the got correct or incorrect.
* Made use of redux by making small components which interact with the store.
